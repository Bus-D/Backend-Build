            <p>
                Hi, I’m Brandon Garrett — a freelance UI/UX and web designer behind Bus-D Designs.
                I specialize in designing clean, intuitive interfaces for websites, web apps,
                and mobile apps, with a strong focus on usability and real-world user experience.
            </p>

            <p>
                I’m currently studying graphic design and web development, and I use my freelance
                work as a way to gain hands-on experience while building products that solve real
                problems. Every project is approached with a balance of visual design, structure,
                and user-focused thinking.
            </p>

            <p>
                My design process emphasizes clarity, consistency, and purpose. I focus on
                understanding user needs, defining clear flows, and creating interface systems
                that are easy to use and ready for development. I design primarily in Figma and
                collaborate closely with clients to ensure each project meets both user and
                business goals.
            </p>

            <p>
                This website was fully designed and coded by me, and it continues to evolve as
                I refine my skills in UI/UX design, accessibility, and front and back-end development.
                I’m always looking to improve and take on projects that challenge me creatively
                and technically.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you’re looking for a freelance UI/UX designer who values thoughtful design,
                clear communication, and practical solutions, I’d love to work with you.
                </p>
